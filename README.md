# GCBASIC Blockly

## Overview
Welcome to **GCBASIC Blockly**, an open-source project that integrates the Blockly visual programming editor with the GCBASIC compiler to create an intuitive block-based coding environment for microcontrollers. This tool allows users to design programs using drag-and-drop blocks, which are then converted into GCBASIC code for PIC microcontrollers. Built on Blockly 10.4.3, this project is ideal for beginners, educators, and hobbyists experimenting with microcontroller projects.

## Features
- Visual block-based programming for GCBASIC.
- Support for common microcontroller operations (e.g., delays, LCD control, variables).
- Custom blocks for GCBASIC-specific constructs (e.g., `select_chip`, `define_constant`).
- Exportable GCBASIC code with comments.
- Workspace management (save, load, reset).
- Interactive console and error logging.
